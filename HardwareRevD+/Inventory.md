# Light string inventory and progress

## Power Supplies
* **3.5A** 1 pc.
* **4.5A** 3 pcs - go Lenovo!
* **6.3A** 1 pc. 
* **dual 3.5A** 1 pc - a monster of a 7.x amp supply, but I don't want anyone putting more than 4.5A into a string. 

### Markings and assembly
All power supplies are laptop power supplies outputting approximately 19V. They are marked with the rated voltage and current on the brick in white paint in most but not all cases. The connectors are replasced with AMP TE SuperSeal two pin connectors.

In many cases, the wire is coaxial, with the sheath being negative, in this case approximately 1 inch of the outer insulation isstripped, the sheath wire twisted together, and the result covered in shrink tube leaving only a the amount requiired for the connector exposed, while the center conductor is treated normally. With the end from which the wires are inserted facing you, and the clip pointing down, positive is to the right. 

To waterproof the joint, act as strain relief, and imoprove appearance and recognizability, the following proceedure is followed prior to installation of the connector: 
1. A length of black PVC braid several inches long is placed over the cable. Allow several inches of extra lengh so that the unsightly frayed ends can be trimmed
2. A length of clear, 3:1 shrink glue lined shrink tube placed over the wires AND the braid. "9.5mm" has been generally appropriate. 
3. If there is a particular concern about strain relief due to the design of the cable, and additional shorther length of 12.7 can also be put over the wires. If used, this is slid over the other two and intitally allowed to fall far from the end.
4. The connector is installed and locked into place with the red retaining clip. 
5. The braid is slid up to the connector with the inevitable frayed part hanging over the connector. 
6. A piece of glow in the dark tape with the current rating written in black sharpie is applied. This is color coded:
    * Blue for 3.5 A
    * White (green glow) for 4.5 A
    * Orange for 6.3 A
    * This leaves several colors unused for future ratings as needed. 
7. The shrink tube is moved to the end of the wire and shrunk into place. this also destroys the frayed ends of the the braid that were hannging out. Glue should be fully melded inside and permeate the pvc braid, ie, it should look black, not like a bunch of air bubbles. 
8. If a second piece of shrink tube was used, slide that over the bottom of the connector and shrink into place
